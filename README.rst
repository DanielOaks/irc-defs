IRC Defs
========
These are IRC definition lists. Things like lists of IRC numerics, channel modes, user modes, and other things that are implemented in various bits of IRC software.

Base data is taken from `alien.net.au <https://www.alien.net.au/irc/>`_, converted to YAML via the tools in the ``_legacy_data`` folder, and adapted for use with the `Jekyll <http://jekyllrb.com/>`_ static site generator (used by Github Pages).

These are being converted one at a time, and will be listed below as they are finished.
