IRC Defs
========
These are IRC definition lists. Things like lists of IRC numerics, channel modes, user modes, and other things that are implemented in various bits of IRC software.

Base data was taken from `alien.net.au <https://www.alien.net.au/irc/>`_, converted to YAML via the tools in the ``_legacy_data`` folder, and adapted for use with the `Jekyll <http://jekyllrb.com/>`_ static site generator (used by Github Pages).

Pull requests to correct or update these lists are welcomed.
