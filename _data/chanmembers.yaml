            Channel member is voiced. They can speak while the channel is
            being moderated. Some implementations also allow them to speak
            when barred from access to the channel for some reason (such as
            being banned)

            User is a channel half-operator, that is they have 'half' the
            access of a full operator. Half-ops can kick unopped users,
            voiced users, set channel modes including +v, but not kick ops
            or deop ops. This leads to greater security on channels.

        prefixchar: "@"
        mode: o

        comment: >
            User is a channel operator. They can kick users, change modes,
            set other users to operator (or lower) status, etc.

    -
        name: PROTECTED

            User is "protected". This means they cannot be kicked or have
            this mode taken away by operators (or other protected users).

            User created the channel. This user usually cannot be kicked
            or have this mode taken away by other users. In some software,
            They may perform actions that operators can, but are at a
            higher privilege level than either operators or protected
            users.

        comment: >
            The user created the channel, but only used for '!' channels
            according to the RFC.

            This is given only by servers or services. It should always be
            the highest ranking membership type in the channel, and denotes
            that the user with the membership status is a service. The
            intended use for this was to mark out which channel member is an
            official channel service, however other applications are also
            available.

            This is given to users when they are given 'founder' status on a
            channel, and should have a rank higher than a normal operator.
