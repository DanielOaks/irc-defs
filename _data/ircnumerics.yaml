            Start of an RPL_ADMIN* reply. In practise, the server parameter
            is often never given, and instead the info field contains the
            text 'Administrative info about <server>'. Newer daemons seem to
            follow the RFC and output the server's hostname in the 'server'
            parameter, but also output the server name in the text as per
            traditional daemons.

            When a server drops a command without processing it, it MUST use
            this reply. Also known as RPL_LOAD_THROTTLED and RPL_LOAD2HI,
            I'm presuming they do the same thing.

            Identical to RPL_AWAY, however this includes the number of
            seconds the user has been away for. This is designed to
            discourage the need for people to use those horrible scripts
            which set the AWAY message every 30 seconds in order to include
            an 'away since' timer.

            Reply to WHO, however it is a 'special' reply because it is
            returned using a non-standard (non-RFC1459) format. The format
            is dictated by the command given by the user, and can vary
            widely. When this is used, the WHO command was invoked in its
            'extended' form, as announced by the 'WHOX' ISUPPORT tag.

            Timezone name is acronym style (eg. 'EST', 'PST' etc). The
            microseconds field is the number of microseconds since the UNIX
            epoch, however it is relative to the local timezone of the
            server. The timezone field is ambiguous, since it only appears
            to include American zones.

            Plain text warning to the user about turning on or off a user
            mode. If no '+' or '-' prefix is used for the mode char, '+' is

            Optionally sent upon connection, and/or sent as a reply to the
            TIME command. This returns the time on the server in a uniform
            manner. The seconds (and optionally nanoseconds) is the time
            since the UNIX Epoch, and is used since many existing timestamps
            in the IRC-2 protocol are done this way (i.e. ban lists). The
            timezone is hours and minutes each of Greenwich ('[+/-]HHMM').
            Since all timestamps sent from the server are in a similar
            format, this numeric is designed to give clients the ability to
            provide accurate timestamps to their users.

            Used to send 'eXtended info' to the client, a replacement for
            the STATS command to send a large variety of data and minimise

            Works similarly to all of KineIRCd's CANNOT* numerics. This one
            indicates that a command could not be performed for an arbitrary
            reason. For example, a halfop trying to kick an op.
