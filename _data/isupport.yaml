        comment: >
            Indicates how many "variable" modes may be set on a channel by a
            single "MODE" command from a client. A "variable" mode is defined

            The value is optional and when not specified indicates that there

        comment: >
            For INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY and indicates the name of the IRC
            network that the client is connected to. A client SHOULD NOT use
            this value to make assumptions about supported features on the
            server.

        examples:
            - "NETWORK=EFNet"

            and their 'order' in terms of channel privlidges they represent,
            from highest to lowest. If the value is not specified, then NO
            channel membership prefixes are supported by this server. These are
            prefixes as listed by the "Channel Membership Prefixes" list on
            this site.

        examples:
            - "PREFIX=(ov)@+"

            Indicates that the client may request a "LIST" command from the
            server without being disconnected due to the large amount of data.
            This token MUST NOT have a value.

        comment: >
            Indicates the maximum number of entries a user may have in their
            'silence' list. The value is OPTIONAL and if not specified
            indicates that there is no limit. The "SILENCE" command seems to
            vary quite a lot between implementations. Most clients include
            client-side filter/ignore commands, and servers have the "CALLERID"
            client mode as alternatives to this command.

        examples:
            - "SILENCE=15"

            Indicates that the client supports a method for the client to send
            a message via the "NOTICE" command to those people on a channel
            with the specified channel membership prefixes. The value MUST be
            specified and MUST be a list of prefixes as specified in the
            "PREFIX" token.

        examples:
            - "STATUSMSG=@+"

            Attempts to indicate the 'standard' to which the ISUPPORT
            implementation is written. Whether this means tokens, or simply
            syntax is not specified. This doesn't seem to be that useful, given
            the age of all these specifications and how it is not officially
            specified nor used all that much.

        examples:
            - "STD=i-d"

        comment: >
            Certain commands from a client MAY contain multiple targets. This
            token defines the maximum number of targets may be specified on
            each of these commands. The value is OPTIONAL and is a set of
            "cmd:number" pairs, where "cmd" refers to the specific command, and
            "number" refers to the limit for this command.
            
            If the number is not specified for a particular command, then that
            command does not have a limit on the maximum number of targets.

        examples:
            - "TARGMAX=PRIVMSG:3,WHOIS:1,JOIN:"

        comment: >
            Indicates the maximum length of a topic that a client may set on a
            channel. Channels on the network MAY have topics with longer
            lengths than this.

            full hostmask of every user listed. Must NOT have a value.
            
            IRCv3 recommends that the "userhost-in-names" client capability is
            used instead of this token.

            The "MONITOR" command is aimed at being a more consistent
            alternative to this command, and documentation for it may be found
            on the IRCv3 website.
