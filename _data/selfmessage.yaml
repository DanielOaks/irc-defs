    name: Self-message client support status
    extra: >
        <p>
            Self-messages are messages sent by yourself from a different
            location, with your own nick in the source of an incoming <tt>PRIVMSG</tt>.
            This used by bouncers and gateways to services that support multiple clients.
            At the protocol level, they look like this:
        </p>
        <pre>:yournick!~foo@example.com PRIVMSG someone_else :Hello world!</pre>
        <p>
            Clients are expected to display that message with the same
            formatting as an outgoing message, in the same window as other
            messages to <tt>someone_else</tt>.
        </p>
        <p>
            The <tt>echo-message</tt> CAP is a superset of this behavior,
            requiring the server to echo messages like this for every outgoing
            message, instead of just the ones from a remote client.
        </p>
        <p>
            Clients marked with * in the status column additionally request the
            <tt>znc.in/self-message</tt> capability from the server, if
            available, which is ZNC's way to avoid sending messages like this
            to clients that don't support it.
        </p>
