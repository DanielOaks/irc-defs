        <p>
            When a server sends a PRIVMSG/NOTICE to someone else on behalf of a client
            connected to it – common when multiple clients are connected to a bouncer – it
            is called a self-message. With the <a href="http://ircv3.net/specs/extensions/echo-message-3.2.html"><tt>echo-message</tt></a>
            capability, they are also sent in reply to every PRIVMSG/NOTICE a client sends.
            These are represented by a protocol message looking like this:
        </p>
        <pre>:yournick!~foo@example.com PRIVMSG someone_else :Hello world!</pre>
        <p>
            They should be put in <tt>someone_else</tt>'s query and displayed as though they
            were sent by the connected client themselves. This page displays which clients
            properly parse and display this type of echo'd PRIVMSG/NOTICE.
        </p>
