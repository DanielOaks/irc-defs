# The server_only field denotes whether or not the mode can be modified by

# The broadcast field specifies whether the mode is broadcast to other

            Follow the autoconnect rules - When set on, the server should
            follow autoconnect parameters given in the configuration file to
            maintain its connection to the network.

            Automatically switch bone/tendril links. This is used in
            association with server to server protocols which have redundant
            links to specify whether or not the server should be actively
            monitoring links to see if a better 'bone' can be selected. When
            on, this gives the server the right to switch bone connections
            around to benifit the network.

        comment: >
            A server turns toggles this depending on its 'fullness'. If the
            server is full, either no more file descriptors are left, or all
            connection classes are full, then this is a warning to other
            servers not to redirect clients to it.

            Indicates the server is a hub. In ircu, this also hides the
            server from users.

        comment: >
            When set, the server should be completely hidden to users. This
            is different to masking the server's name. This allows for
            invisible hubs, or invisible servers which host network
            services, etc.

        comment: >
            Server should consider itself a lazy leaf link to the network.
            This means only one connection can be made to the server, and it
            runs on lazy principles. The idea for lazy leafs comes from
            Hybrid.

            Marks the given language code as the 'default' language for that
            server. Language codes are that prescribed by BCP-0047, and only
            one can be set at a time.

            The server modes are locked, and can only be changed by other
            servers. This is useful when servers shouldn't not be touched by
            operators. Arbiters/U:lines servers can still change modes (i.e.
            to remove this mode!)

            When set, the server is a 'service' (as in, it only provides
            services). In ircu, this also hides the server from users.

        comment: >
            Mark the server as being under a 'testlink' period. Many
            networks give new servers a testing period to give both the
            server administrator, and the network, time to evaluate whether
            or not the server will be able to remain permanent. Depending on
            network policy, testlink server administrators may have
            restricted rights, such as not being able to send global
            messages. This flag aids to enforce those policies.
